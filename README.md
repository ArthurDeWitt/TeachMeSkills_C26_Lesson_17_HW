# HW0
Create a generalized functional interface.
Write a class with a single method.
In this method, implement the logic:
	- if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use an interface with a string type and pass the logic of reversing the string (outputting the string in reverse order) to the interface method.

	- If the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use an interface with integer type and pass the logic of finding the factorial of a number into the interface method.
